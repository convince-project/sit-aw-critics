CONVINCE SIT-AW-CRITICS
=======================

SIT-AW-CRITICS implements logic rules (critics) and inference to detect and reduce hallucinations of general-purpose AI like multi-modal large language models. It is a crucial process in a robot situation awareness pipeline.

In this documentation we introduce the generic principles behind the SIT-AW-CRITICS framework. Then, we describe how to build and run SIT-AW-CRITICS. Finally, we provide a tutorial to see SIT-AW-CRITICS in action.
